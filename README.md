# Cube3D

Cube3D is a 3D raycasting project written in C, inspired by classic games like Wolfenstein 3D. It allows the player to explore a maze from a first-person perspective, featuring basic movement, wall rendering, simple monster following, and player sprint, using the MiniLibX graphics library.

## Features

- First-person maze exploration
- Basic movement (forward, backward, strafe, turn)
- Wall rendering using raycasting
- Monster movement: monsters follow the player if within range
- Player sprint: temporarily increases movement speed
- Built with MiniLibX graphics library
